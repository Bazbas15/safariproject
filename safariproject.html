<h1> Air Safari </h1>

<h2> The Month Of Air</h2>

<p> class="center">This month, March 2018, will be the latest reintroduction of the <strong>Nike Air Safari</strong>.  It debuted more than 30 years ago in 1987.  While it’s appearance today in would elicit double takes in certain circles, at the time of its release, when white based sneakers were more de rigueur, its grayish ostrich outer trim, rust orange toe box area and black saddle were audacious to the point of near blasphemy.</p>

<h2> The Revolution </h2>

<p> class="center">I first encountered the shoe in 1987 through a spread <a href=“https://https://sneakernews.com/2012/11/28/vintage-1987-nike-ads/">ad</a> in GQ magazine.  It was the industry standard fluffy September issue and it was the most if not all of the Nike shoe releases for the fall.  While there were some shoes that I found covetous like the <strong>Nike Air Trainer 1</strong> of Bo Jackson fame, the Safari still stood out.  My youthful understanding and nascent taste couldn’t grasp the need for a pair of shoes that didn’t help you play better in any sport much less a walking conversation piece.</p>

<h2> Rediscovery</h2>
<p> class="center">I assumed the Safari was a shooting star across the sneaker sky until I took the treacherous plunge into the sneaker subculture.  I was not aware of the growing legend that started after the shoe was worn by the rapper Biz Markie on the back cover of his debut album, <strong>Goin Off</strong>.  It had acquired cult status as tine passed, something that distinguished serious collectors from dilettantes.  Nike reissued the shoe in 2003 and 2012.  There have also been countless of references over the years through other Nike models as well as a New Balance shoe that riffed on the theme as well.</p>
